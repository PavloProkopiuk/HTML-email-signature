# Responsive HTML Email Signature - Pixel Perfect Development

This project features a high-quality, professional HTML email signature developed from a specific design brief. It is engineered to maintain visual integrity across all major email clients while providing a seamless experience on mobile devices.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Mobile Responsive (Fluid Hybrid Layout):** Unlike standard signatures that simply shrink, this signature uses a stacking method. Blocks (Name, Contact, Logo) automatically realign vertically on narrow screens to ensure readability.
* **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Developed using table-based HTML and inline CSS to ensure consistent rendering in **Microsoft Outlook (Desktop & Web)**, **Gmail**, **Apple Mail**, and **Yahoo**.
* **Pixel Perfect Design:** Exact implementation of the brand's visual identity, including the specific color palette ($#4e6144$ and $#a8b093$) and the decorative horizontal bands as seen in the original brief.
* **Data Integrity:** Implemented `white-space: nowrap` and multi-column contact layouts to prevent phone numbers and email addresses from breaking awkwardly on small displays.
* **Outlook Optimization:** Includes MSO (Microsoft Outlook) conditional comments to force correct widths and prevent layout collapsing in older versions of Outlook.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* **HTML5:** Table-based structure for email client support.
* **CSS3:** Inline styling for maximum compatibility.
* **MSO Logic:** Conditional code specifically for the Outlook rendering engine.
